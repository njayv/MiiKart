# Mii Kart!
## What is Mii Kart?
Mii Kart is an in-dev arcade racer where you race around a number of tracks using your own Mii*
###### *Mii implementation will be nearer full release
## How does Mii Kart find my Mii?
Here's the neat thing! It doesn't! (kidding)

Mii Kart will (hopefully) be using <a href="https://mii.nxw.pw">datkat21's Mii Editor</a> with either its .miic filetypes or any other data. I could also add discord implementation so I can grab it straight from the profile, but that will all be explained when it fully releases :)

## Can I play Mii Kart at its current state?
Luckily you can! The only thing I gotta say is that it's still really early in development, so expect minor and major bugs ranging from input, performace, and physics.

Oh! And the link to the game is quite literally <a href="https://miikart.github.io">miikart.github.io</a>
